# Math-Neural-Network-in-C
<p>This simple neural network was originally written in Python (https://www.sololearn.com/learn/744/?ref=app). I converted it to C to deepen my understanding of both languages, as well as of neural networks.</p>
<p>This project was my very first time coding in C, as well as my first time coding a neural network.</p>
